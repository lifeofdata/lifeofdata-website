# To Deploy...

You will need to create a WordPress configuration file on your first access. The installer will step you through this when you first access the admin interface (usually at /wp-admin on the installation).

You will need PHP and MySQL running on the server.

Site-specific configurations are kept in the SLOD theme.

Do no upgrade any plugins with '-fork' in their name, as this may adversely affect the functionality of the site.
